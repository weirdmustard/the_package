The Package

1) You received a package. 
a) I don't care. (2)
b) What is it? (3)
c) No, I don't. (4)

2) But you do. You are actually pretty excited to find out, what it is. (5)
a) Super excited. (5)

3) That's the question, isn't it. You didn't order anything. (5)
a) Maybe someone else did. (5)

4) You can't run from the package, it's there and it has to be dealt with. (5)
a) Meh. (5)

5) You put the package on your coffee table and forget about it for the next few hours. When you sit down on the couch in the evening, putting your feet on the table, your legs hit the package.
a) Gotta deal with it now, I guess. (6)

6) Damn right, you do. You pick up the package.
a) Look at it. (7)
b) Smell it. (8)
c) Talk to it. (9)

7) It's a simple cardboard brown package with no labels. It seems like whomever left you the package put it right infront of your door.
a) I want to open it. (10)
b) Smell it. (8)
c) Talk to it. (9)

8) You raise the package to your nose. Sometimes when you order tea or spices, they smell good through the box. This one doesn't. You don't smell anything.
a) Let me open it then. (10)
b) Look closer. (7)
c) Talk to it. (9)

9) You look at the package from a distance. "Hi." you say. The package doesn't reply. "Something livin' in there?" Apparently not, the package stays silent.
a) Probably safe to open then. (10)
b) Any clues on the outside? (7)
c) Smell it. (8)

10) The package is neatly closed up with transparent tape. You could technically pull on it. 
a) That's gonna work out just fine. (11)
b) Let me get the boxcutter. (12)

11) You start pulling at the tape and for about half the width it actually comes off clean. Then it frays into different lines and sections and ruins your day. You get the boxcutter.
a) My day is ruined. (12)
b) My day is not ruined, why would I let this piece of shitty tape ruin my day. (12)

12) You slice through the tape and open up the sides, careful not to scratch anything that might be inside. You bend the flaps and look inside. There's nothing there. 
a) What do you mean, nothing? (13)
b) I don't know what I expected. (13)
c) Air isn't "nothing". (13)

13) I mean, it is kind of disappointing, but imagine what could have been inside the box.
a) I guess, it could have been anthrax. (14)
b) Why would I think about anthrax. (14)
c) Is it anthrax? (14)

14) Right. It could have been anthrax, but anthrax comes as a powder, so you should be safe.
a) What if it's something airborne?? (15)
b) Let me check again. (16)

15) If it's airborne, you already caught it, no matter what it is. Maybe if you check the box again, you may find out why someone would do that to you.
a) Let's check the box, I need to know. (16)
b) I'll go take a shower to get it off me. (17)

16) As you check the box again, you find that there is something between the folds on the bottom of the box. It's a micro-SD, unwrapped.

17) As you hurry to the bathroom and lose your clothes on the way there, there's a knock on the door.
a) Oh shit. (18)
b) Oh shit. (18)
c) Oh shit. (18)

18) You grab the bathrobe you haven't used in ages from the hooks on the door, put it on and rip open the door. Your middleaged neighbour seems confused and worried at the same time. Hands in his pockets and looking down the hallway to both sides he whispers "Did you get a package?".
a) "I did, in fact. Did you get one, too?" (19)
b) "Hey Frank. I'm sorry, what package?" (20)
c) "Oh sorry, I opened it, didn't know it was yours." (21)

19) Frank shoves you aside and enters your apartment. He walks up to the couch where you put the package down before fleeing the scene. He takes the package and shakes it until a small object falls to the ground. It seems to have been hidden in the bottom folds of the box. Frank picks it up and holds it to eye level. It's a micro-SD. He looks at you before he pushes through the bathroom door. You are too overwhelmed by the whole situation to stop him and hear the toilet flush just a few seconds later. 
a) "Frank?" (22)

20) >>> CONT NEEDED <<<

21) >>> CONT NEEDED <<<

22) When you open the door to your bathroom, Frank is on the ground next to the toilet. He seems to be crying. 
a) "Frank, are you okay?" (23)
b) "What happened?" (23)
